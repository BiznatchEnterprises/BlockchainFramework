Project #1: BlockChain Framework for PHP

This project attempts to standardize private "side-chain" implementations capable of running "on-top" of the existing Bitcoin node networks. This will increase functionality, as well as security for Enterprise open-source projects and their implementations of DAPPS (Decentralized Applications), DAO (Decentralized autonomous organizations), smart-contracts and other revolutionary technologies waiting to be developed!

Dynamic Blockchain Database -> Public -> Private -> Semi-Private

Dynamic Applications (PHP/xHTML) -> Execute PHP Scripting -> Load & Display xHTML/Javascript snippets -> Node2Peer API Protocol (JSON, XML, ETC)

Dynamic Database Compression -> Multiple Algorithms

Dynamic Security Protocols -> Application Layers (Sandboxing) -> Database Layers (prevent data-corruption) -> Protocol Layers

Database Synchronization -> Node2Node API Protocol
