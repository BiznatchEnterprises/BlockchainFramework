Project #1: BlockChain Framework for PHP

This project attempts to standardize private "side-chain" implementations capable of running "on-top" of the existing Bitcoin node networks. This will increase functionality, as well as security for Enterprise open-source projects and their implementations of DAPPS (Decentralized Applications), DAO (Decentralized autonomous organizations), smart-contracts and other revolutionary technologies waiting to be developed!
