BlockChain Framework Project

"Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world. Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence." - Louis Pasteur

Project #1: BlockChain Framework for PHP

This project attempts to standardize private "side-chain" implementations capable of running "on-top" of the existing Bitcoin node networks. This will increase functionality, as well as security for Enterprise open-source projects and their implementations of DAPPS (Decentralized Applications), DAO (Decentralized autonomous organizations), smart-contracts and other revolutionary technologies waiting to be developed!
